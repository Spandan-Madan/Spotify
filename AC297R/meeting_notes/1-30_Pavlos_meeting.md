# Meeting with Pavlos, Jan 30 (10am)

* First initial meeting, all team-mates met for the first time.
* Acoustic audio features were explored the year before. It was suggested looking at other sources of information (lyrics for example) might be more fruitful.
* Spandan suggested using a word2vec, approach with title text from the songs.
* We were given guidelines of how to work and interact with our partners at Spotify.
