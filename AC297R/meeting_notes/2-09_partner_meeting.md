# Partner Meeting (Feb 9 2:30-3pm EST)

* Joe and Aparna (Spotify) told us we should treat this project as separate from spotify. They could not divulge any information about their current efforts.
* The seemed to hint that we should try out different types of information and different metrics. Not focus too much on the model, but more the information.
* They thought lyrics were a good idea (Along with Youtube).
* Seemed to hint that we should look at the order of songs.
* Spandan gave a demo of his word2vec model for suggesting.
* Joe mentioned how we can frame this problem around pool identification and ranking (2 step, like we are doing right now).
* Reinforcement Learning is a interesting venue to look at but the metric is going to be hard.
