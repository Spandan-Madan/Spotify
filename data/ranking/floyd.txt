So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue sky from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?2

A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?

Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
